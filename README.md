# detection-and-recognition-of-TS
## Basically, two steps were tried to be implemented in this project.
## The first step is to detect the region of the traffic sign in the image given with the YOLO.
## The second step is to classify the traffic sign in the detected region by giving it to the trained (97% accuracy) CNN model.

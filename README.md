## Detection and Recognition of Traffic Signs
### Basically, two steps were tried to be implemented in this project.
### The first step is to detect the region of the traffic sign in the given image using the YOLO.
### The second step is to classify the traffic sign in the detected region by giving it to the trained (97% accuracy) CNN model.

To run project, you should dowloand trained  models (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T6zBWNTJLr-vGJzu8kLTMHc4j7alVSKk?usp=share_link)
